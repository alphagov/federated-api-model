# API

The API is the main resource the federated model is concerned about.

- Unique identifier ([[id]])
- Name ([[text]])
- Description ([[markdown]])
- URL ([[url]])


The [[catalogue-api]] describes the API resource in terms of a RESTful API using [[json]] but the federated model can be expressed using other models such as [[graphql]] schema, [[protobuffs]] or [[rdf]].
