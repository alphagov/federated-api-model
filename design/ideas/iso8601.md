# ISO 8601

[ISO 8601] specifies how to format dates, times and durations accounting for different degrees of accuracy (from just a year like "2022" to a point in time like "2022-01-10T14:54:00Z").

It's flexibility makes it hard to implement and it is often required to create a specific profile constraining it to a useable subset. For example [IETF RFC 3339] is only concerned with points in time that include second precision whereas the W3C [Date and Time Formats] keeps points in time from year to seconds with an unspecified precision for under the second information and leaves out time intervals, calendar weeks, and other less known parts of the specification.

The UK government has it standardised in [Formatting dates and times in data] which roughly aligns with both [IETF RFC 3339] and [Date and Time Formats] depending on the use case.
