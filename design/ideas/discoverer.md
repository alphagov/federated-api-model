# Discoverer

The **discoverer** implements a consumer for a discovery protocol (undefined, see [[registry#Discovery]] for a potential avenue). ^973752

The objective would be to actively find [[provider]] implementors as well as basic information about them and the owner [[organisation]].

Such solution should help mitigate getting a [[registry]] out of sync but will not be a sufficient solution alone.
