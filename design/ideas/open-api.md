# OpenAPI

The [OpenAPI] Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic.

An OpenAPI specification MUST be compliant with [[json]] even if written as [[yaml]].


Notice that Open API v3.1 is the first version that is actually compatible with [[json-schema]] although it does _not_ implement all of JSON Schema 2019-09. Whenever compatibility is needed read [Update on OpenAPI and JSON Schema](https://phil.tech/2019/update-openapi-json-schema/).
