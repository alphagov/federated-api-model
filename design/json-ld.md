# JSON-LD

[JSON-LD] is a [Linked Data] format based on [[json]]. It is interoperable [[rdf]] and widely implemented on RDF stores (see [relationship to RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#relationship-to-rdf)).

Although JSON-LD 1.0 was recommended by the W3C in 2014 it has a noticeable smaller set of implementations than for example [[json-schema]]. The fewer though seem to be catching up quickly with the new JSON-LD 1.1 specification recommended in 2020.
