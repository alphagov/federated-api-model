# Organisation

An **organisation resource** aims to identify an organisation uniquely as well as providing a point of contact.

- Unique identifier ([[id]]).
- Organisation URL ([[url]])
- Organisation Name ([[text]])
- Organisation Email ([[email]])


Short term this information is likely to be manually curated but would be good to explore the [[registry#Discovery]] solution for a robust, scalable solution.


## Unknowns

- [ ] It would be great to have unique identifiers for public organisations reused across government but they don't exist nor a solution to cope with it. There is an idea floating around on self-minting identifiers for departments and ALBs but it's no way near maturity. Also it would be trickier to do that accounting for organsiations outside of central government.
